       Sample XML source:

       <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <family name="Kawasaki">
           <father>Yasuhisa</father>
           <mother>Chizuko</mother>
           <children>
               <girl>Shiori</girl>
               <boy>Yusuke</boy>
               <boy>Kairi</boy>
           </children> </family>

       Sample program to read a xml file and dump it:

           use XML::TreePP;
           use Data::Dumper;
           my $tpp = XML::TreePP->new();
           my $tree = $tpp->parsefile( "family.xml" );
           my $text = Dumper( $tree );
           print $text;

       Result dumped:

           $VAR1 = {
               'family' => {
                   '-name' => 'Kawasaki',
                   'father' => 'Yasuhisa',
                   'mother' => 'Chizuko',
                   'children' => {
                       'girl' => 'Shiori'
                       'boy' => [
                           'Yusuke',
                           'Kairi'
                       ],
                   }
               }
           };

       Note:

           The father's given name is in $tree->{family}->{father}.
           The family name of the family is in $tree->{family}->{"-name"}.
           The prefix '-' is added on every attributes' name.

           The second boy's name is in $tree->{family}->{children}->{boy}->[1].
           The array is used because the family has two boys.

           The girl's name is in $tree->{family}->{children}->{girl}.

       Text node and attributes:

           If a element has both of a text node and attributes
           or both of a text node and other child nodes,
           value of a text node is moved to "#text" like child nodes.

           use XML::TreePP;
           use Data::Dumper;
           my $tpp = XML::TreePP->new();
           my $source = '<span class="author">Kawasaki Yusuke</span>';
           my $tree = $tpp->parse( $source );
           my $text = Dumper( $tree );
           print $text;

           The result dumped is following:

           $VAR1 = {
               'span' => {
                   '-class' => 'author',
                   '#text' => 'Kawasaki Yusuke'
               }
           };

           The special node name of "#text" is used because this elements
           has attribute(s) in addition to the text node.

           my $tpp = XML::TreePP->new( %attributes )
               This method constructs a new "XML::TreePP" object.
               Optional attributes are following:

           output_encoding => "UTF-8",
               You can define a encoding of xml file generated by write/writefile
               methods. On Perl 5.8.x and later, you can select it from every
               encodings supported by Encode.pm. On Perl 5.6.x or before with
               Jcode.pm, you can use "Shift_JIS", "EUC-JP", "ISO-2022-JP" and
               "UTF-8". The default value is "UTF-8".

           array_element => [],
               This option allows you to specify a list of element names which
               should always be forced into an array representation
               The default value is null, it means that context of the elements
               will determine to make array or to keep it scalar.

           my $tree = $tpp->parse( $source );
               This method reads XML source and returns a hash tree converted.
               The first argument is a scalar or a reference to a scalar.

           my $tree = $tpp->parsefile( $file );
               This method reads a XML file and returns a hash tree converted.
               The first argument is a filename.

           my $tree = $tpp->parsefile( $method, $url, $body );
               This method receive a XML file from a remote server via HTTP and
               returns a hash tree converted.
               This medhot requires LWP::UserAgent module.
               $method is a method of HTTP connection: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
               $url is URI of a XML file.
               $body is request body when you use POST method.

           my $source = $tpp->write( $tree );
               This method parse a hash tree and returns a XML source generated.
               $tree is a referecen to a hash tree.

           $tpp->writefile( $file, $tree );
               This method parse a hash tree and writes a XML source into a file.
               $file is a filename to create.
               $tree is a referecen to a hash tree.
